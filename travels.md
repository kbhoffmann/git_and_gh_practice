My favorite travel experience was a snowboarding trip to Switzerland in 2008.  
I also have many memorable vacations with my boyfriend including many trips to the Seattle,WA,  Portland,OR and Bend, OR areas.  We've also gone to Salt Lake City, UT and Austin, TX.  
In 2014 we took a 10 day road trip around CA including snowboarding in Tahoe, exploring San Francisco and Monterrey, CA.
